Adds 34 ships, many new weapons, 4 new races, 8  new unique crew, 1 new hazard type, and 8 entirely new sectors. 

Adventure into the outer reaches of the galaxy and discover some of the more interesting races from across the multiverse.

Meet the Acidic Growth, a hivemind like space algae that has managed to build itself ships and mechs. Hide from them in the Acidic Nebula but beware of the clouds eating away at your ship.

Meet an Exiled faction of Engi Heretics, seperatists so appalling they've been beaten back by both engi and seperatists alike. These vile engi have mastered control of their own nanobots and are able to use them to resurrect the dead to fight for them.

Meet the Gi, a bird like race who have developed some powerful drones. The Location of their sectors is still unknown, coming soon.

Meet the Cult of the Bud A group of vampweeds who worship a giant space flower and draw upon it's power to perform various magical tasks. The Location of their sectors is still unknown, coming soon.

Finally discover the technology of a long lost race, but be careful you might just get caught up in more than you expected.
